= Task 6: Docker-Compose
:tip-caption: Tip

Let's connect multiple containers on the same network as one logical application.


. Databases are a perfect candidate since they are usually accompanied by some GUI standalone application.
  PostgreSQL and Adminer are one such example

. Write a compose file consisting of both applications and Adminer should depend on postgres to start.
 .. docker-compose key abastracions are required:
   version, services, image, restart, environment, depends_on, ports...

Make 

TIP: `docker-compose up`
