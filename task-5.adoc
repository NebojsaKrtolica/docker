= Task 5: Docker-Network
:tip-caption: Tip

Let's connect multiple containers on the same network via logical names.

A local Docker-Network `docnet` exists (...or is about to exist :P).

. Start both containers from this workshop "hello barco" and "the curly one".
Make sure both containers have a meaningful name and are running on the same docker-network.

No port is to be published on the local machine.

. Try to reach the "hello barco" container from inside the "curly" one with:
 `curl <container-name>:9080/hello-barco/resources/hello` or `curl <container-name>:9080`.

TIP: `docker run --name <name> --network <network> <image>`
