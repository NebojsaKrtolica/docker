= Task 4: Software-Installation
:tip-caption: Tip

Build a Docker-Image from Base-Image `debian:8.11`, that installs the app `curl`.

Hint: a company proxy may be in the way of things, so that `apt-get` is in danger.

. Create a new `Dockerfile` from the base-image `debian:8.11`.

. Proxy: make sure the file `70debconf` is under `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/` .

. Install `curl` with the Docker-Build via `apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`.

. Start a container from the freshly created image and make sure that curl is there.
