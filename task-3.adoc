= Task 3: Application or simple index.html
:tip-caption: Tipp

. Build a Docker-Image, which has an application or web server i.e. Liberty-Server with the app "`Hello Barco`" or nginx web server with an index.html inside of it.
Use as Base-Image `websphere-liberty:javaee8` or nginx.
The app is `hello-barco.war`.
For Liberty:  
To deploy the app automatically on start:
it should be available under `/config/dropins`

. Start a Docker-Container of the image with locally published port `9080`.

. Reach the application with  `curl localhost:9080/hello-barco/resources/hello` or `curl localhost:9080`.

TIP: `docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image>`
